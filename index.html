	<h1> Colors (ROYGBIV) </h1>
	<h2 class="a" title="Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan."><span class="a"><mark class="a">R</mark></span>ed is the color of fire and passion.</h2>
	<h2 class="o" title="Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light. Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In traditional colour theory, it is a secondary colour of pigments, produced by mixing yellow and red."> <span class="o"><mark class="o">O</mark></span>range represents energy and enthusiasm. </h2>
	<h2 class="y" title="Yellow is the color between green and orange on the spectrum of light. It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 575–585 nm. It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing."><span class="y"><mark class="y">Y</span></mark>ellow symbolizes joy and happiness. </h2>
	<h2 class="g" title="Green is the color between cyan and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm." ><span class="g"><mark class="g">G</mark></span>reen signifies growth and harmony. </h2>
	<h2 class="b" title="Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres."><span class="b"><mark class="b">B</mark></span>lue evokes a sense of calmness and serenity. </h2>
	<h2 class="i" title="Indigo is a deep color close to the color wheel blue, as well as to some variants of ultramarine, based on the ancient dye of the same name. The word indigo comes from the Latin word indicum, meaning Indian, as the dye was originally exported to Europe from India"><span class="i"><mark class="i">I</mark></span>ndigo represents intuition and spirituality. </h2>
	<h2 class="v" title="Violet is the color of light at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum, between blue and invisible ultraviolet. It is one of the seven colors that Isaac Newton labeled when dividing the spectrum of visible light in 1672. Violet light has a wavelength between approximately 380 and 435 nanometers."><span class="v"><mark class="v">V</mark></span>iolet is associated with creativity and inspiration. </h2>
